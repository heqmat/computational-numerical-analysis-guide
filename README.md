# Computational Numerical Analysis Guide
This repository is dedicated to discuss derivations of numerical analysis algorithms or applications of them to programming for engineering purposes or computational molecular sciences.
Feel free to ask about questions, correct mistakes in proof, codes etc. or add new strategies, approaches (It's even better if your work is novel)
You can send pull requests so that we can create small guide page for specific use cases.
