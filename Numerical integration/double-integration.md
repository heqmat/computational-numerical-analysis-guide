Double integral is integral of two-variable functions such as z=x+y, z=x^2+y^3, z=x+5/y and so on.

This notation can be used to approximate double integrals:

where (d,c) and (b,a) are points that represent the range at y or x axises and Δx is infinitesimal which means less Δx, more better approximation you have.

The above expression is equivalent of this expression when a limit is applied as Δx approaches to 0:
