Double integral is integral of two-variable functions such as z=x+y, z=x^2+y^3, z=x+5/y and so on.

This notation can be used to approximate double integrals:

where (d,c) and (b,a) are points that represent the interval on y or x axises and Δx is infinitesimal which means less Δx, more better approximation you have.

The above expression is equivalent to the expression in the picture when a limit is applied as Δx approaches to 0:

Computing this notation takes extremely long. It's good idea to write the algorithm in an efficient low-level programming language.
